# Earth Analytics Assignment Notebook Releases

The Earth Analytics program at Earthlab, University of Colorado Boulder, teaches the skills necessary to get started with Earth Data Science, including:;
  * Introduction to programming in Python
  * Developing reproducible scientific workflows
  * Working with open spatial and time-series data
  * Collaboration and version control using git and GitHub
  * Science communication
  
These notebooks are testing-ready assignments for the Earth Analytics program. They are Jupyter Python notebooks with all solutions removed using [nbgrader](https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). The original assignments can be found at the [assignment repository](https://github.com/earth-analytics-edu/ea-assignment-notebooks) if you have access.

This repository is prepared using continuous integration, and no one but the CI bot should be permitted to commit to it.

Use [abc-classroom](https://abc-classroom.readthedocs.io) to distribute these releases to students:
  1. Set up an abc classroom directory as described in the documentations
  2. Copy the desired notebooks to the abc release directory
  3. Use abc classroom to upload the assignment to GitHub Classroom

This repository should be tagged each semester, e.g. 21-22-2-python (program start yy - program end yy - semester number - course name).
